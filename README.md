# Student Directory

This was the 4/4 part of the Makers Academy Pre-Course. It involved following a tutorial to build up an interactive menu app that listed students who were enrolled in a school. This was pretty much my first OOP project, and I have chose to leave it as it is, rather than refactor, to show just how far I have come on my coding journey, and to remins me of just that!

It is not Encapsulated, not very DRY at all, but was my first whole project!


## Features
- The user can input students into the school
- The user can show all the students of the school
- The user can save a particular list of students to a .csv file
